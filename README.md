# recommender-system
The purpose of this project is to use machine learning algorithms and big data processing to implement a system that recommends time for booking appointments in hair salons. By analyzing the history of reservations, user preferences, and other features, this system suggests the best possible times for reservations to provide both improved customer experience and time optimization for hair salons.
